I love mornings, especially rainy ones. I like to sit alone, watch the rain as the world still sleeps.

I get to witness stillness. I get to listen to my cluttered thoughts in solitude. I get to think about life.

Life that is not one smooth-sailing ship.

Looking back, I never would have imagined life as it is now. It’s not what was planned. It isn’t the ideal.

This time, it seems the rain and I are taking turns in watching each other.

And the rain’s currently winning. It feels sad and heavy. But somehow, there is peace.

I made a mistake. Should I stay indoors or enjoy the rain outside?

It isn’t anyone’s fault but mine. And there’s nothing I can do but face it, whichever choice I make. I must feel the pain and tough it out. Let time heal all wounds.

Problems are constant in life just like the rain. But so are mornings – new beginnings.

No matter how gloomy our day went, there will always be another morning. And if that turns out gloomy as well, there’s always the next day.
