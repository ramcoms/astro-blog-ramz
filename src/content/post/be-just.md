Often, I try to make things simple and go straight to the point. Remove the unnecessary and focus on the basics. Most cases are binary. Yes-no. On-off. Up-down. Accept-reject.

Some seem to offer more complicated choices. But deep down, it still boils down to two options. And then it’s a matter of weighing the pros and cons.

How do we get decisive? I usually am. Unfortunately, there are certain things that would really test you. Especially when the heart and mind are not on the same page. The classic devil-and-angel-in-the-shoulders cliché.

When both have benefits and consequences, how do we decide? How do we weigh the pros and cons? How can we fairly decide? Maybe with some mathematical formula. Or with some bs chart and graph. Spin the bottle or with a coin toss probably. If only life was that easy.

Either way, **we can never have it all**.

You can choose to be happy than be right.

Or go for what is right and accept what is.

But what if choosing your happiness is the right path?

There can never be a balance between logic and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBgAj4cNee4'>emotion</a>. **We can never be just**.
