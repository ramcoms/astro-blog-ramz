Lately I learned that ISPs recycle postpaid mobile numbers. Mine is one.

So I get calls from unknown numbers every time. And whenever I answer some by mistake, I’d be greeted by a ‘May I speak with (a certain someone)?’ spiel to which I quickly reply with a cold ‘Sorry, wrong number’.

It was fine at first but it got annoying eventually.

Now my simple rule is: **never answer an unknown number**. I don’t care if it’s a credit card agent offering promos. Or the president of the country.

If it’s an emergency, I’m pretty sure you’ll ring me twice or at least send a message once.
