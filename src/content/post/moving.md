At the start of the year, a news greeted us.

The city is planning a road-widening project in our area which would affect a large portion of our rented apartment. I thought the project would progress slowly, yet the groundwork already started around June. In July, we searched for a new apartment and started packing. In September, we moved out.

It was a long search with considerations on the price and location. Due to urgency, we settled for a 2BR apartment in a nearby barangay. The rent is much higher but the family likes it. So I’ll just have to make room in the budget.

After finding a place, the actual packing took place. I like organizing stuff but packing felt tedious before it even started. Figuring where and how to start would make one’s head hurt. We decided not to bring everything and sent most of the stuff, the non-essentials, to our house in the province. (We are addressed in the province but we chose to currently live in the Metro since we are all working here, for convenience). Thankfully, we were able to move out and settle in about a week.

The place we transferred to is part of a 6-door apartment. And there’s one thing I’m not used to – neighbors. I’m not anti-people by any means, but I’m not the chatty type as well. Not that I have to but getting along with the next-door-people would be a challenge. It doesn’t help that some aren’t keen on making new friends at all.

Generally, the transfer went better than I expected. Aside from finding a place, packing and moving stuff were the greatest hassle. It’s scary and a bit exciting. New surroundings, new people, new challenges.
