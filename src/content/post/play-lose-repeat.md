It was a sunny Wednesday morning. Just outside the soccer field, I sat on the grass. Beside me was one teammate also watching the game anxiously. I was soaked in sweat not because of the heat but because of the intense back-and-forth action. We were cheering loudly trying to motivate our teammates. It was a tight game so my chance of playing became slimmer. The waterboy had seen more action than me. Out of nowhere, my teammate suddenly murmured, “I don’t care if we lose, as long as I play.” I was thinking otherwise. I did not care about playing. I wanted to win.

Two decades later, I ponder on that same statement. But this time, I agree on some level. I think the same is true in life.

The old me was a people-pleaser, a _yes_ person. I was thinking too much of what others thought about me. So I was afraid of failures and conformed with the norm. I had no idea what I wanted so I followed the path other people want. I kept playing safe and stayed on the sidelines. It got me somewhere at least.

But failure is not something one could escape from. Because **life is not always butterflies and rainbows.** I figure I could afford to lose and try again. Now I am not afraid to fail. I am ready to take responsibility when things went wrong. Yes, even the best fall down sometimes.

I should give myself the chance to play. **Focus on the experience, the goal comes second.**
