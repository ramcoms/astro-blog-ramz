It was an early Saturday morning. I was at a gas station having my motorcycle fueled up. There was a slight commotion between a customer and a crew.

Before attending to me, the crew shared, _“Kulang daw ng 67 cents yung sukli nya (referring to the customer). Iba talaga ang mayayaman Sir. Bilang lagi yung pera.”_

At first, I thought, if that was me, that would have been fine. 67 cents isn’t that big a deal. So naturally, I quickly judged the customer. His car’s not even that good, I told myself.

Then I realized three things.

First, if that’s the way he is, why would I care. **We have our way of living and differing opinions.** If someone’s actions do not conform with my beliefs, I should not have any problems with that and mind my own business. As they say, to each his own.

Second, I am conscious of my money too. I monitor my every financial transaction like a ~~madman~~ businessman. DOWN TO THE LAST CENT. I’ve had this habit for quite some time now. Like what I always like to mention in this blog, **what gets measured gets improved**. Every penny counts. That being said, I would have still let that 67 cents go.

Lastly, **the rich live simply**. It isn’t recency bias. But I’ve known or met rich people who just don’t care. Like they’re in a club with plain white shirt, shorts/pants, and slippers as their uniform. It served as a reminder that showing off achieves nothing. I’d rather be rich in my pajamas driving a sedan than be broke in branded clothes boasting an SUV.
