Today is my birthday, my ‘special’ day.

I’ve said this like a million times already. But I’m not really a big fan of celebrations. What’s there to celebrate anyway?

Don’t get me wrong. I’m grateful to have survived another year. But aren’t we supposed to give thanks every day? They also say that your birthday is a chance to share your blessings. But isn’t being generous a default on our daily lives?

So what makes this day extra special?

I appreciate the greetings, especially from people who I rarely talk to, yet took the time to send a message and a beer emoji. Aside from that, it’s just another day on my calendar.

I may sound like a broken and bitter record. Just bear with me, it’s my birthday.

Grumpiness aside, here are some ideas to ponder.

You can mark birthdays as a turning point, similar to the new year. You can set resolutions, expectations, and goals. Birthday = _reset_ day.

You can also have your goals reviewed on this special day. I think you are more likely to do self-development stuff on your birthday rather than on the last Sunday of every quarter. So the practice is probably more sustainable. Doing so might make the habit stick.

These may prove effective as there seems to be renewed enthusiasm on this very hopeful day.

Whatever floats your boat, have it your way. Whether you prefer a grand celebration or an intimate one, the choice is yours.

You do you.
