There’s this phrase I heard last year that got me thinking. “Do the new.”

And with the new year coming in, there isn’t a better time to ponder on it once again.

Most of the time, life is boring and routine. Throw in some hurdles and you get an interesting joyride. But when was the last time you got excited because of the highs?

Between coffee and desk calendars, who has the time to learn a new skill?

Who has the time to visit the newly-opened ramen shop on the next block? Or go to a totally-secluded place and unwind under the sky and stars? Or meet new people?

This year, find time to do something you’ve never done. Find time to go somewhere you’ve never been to.

Learn a new skill. Learn to play a new instrument.

Log your new “thing” monthly. It could be a place, a book, a dish, or a movie. It could be anything.

Make life a bit more interesting with the hurdles and highs.

But don’t bother much with the hurdles. They’re always there.

Be responsible looking for the highs, ways to feel alive.

Do the new.
