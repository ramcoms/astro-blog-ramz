Life is a master of surprises. One day you feel you’re on the top, the next day you’ve hit rock bottom. You never really know what to expect. But isn’t that a good thing? Never worrying about what will or won’t happen.

Cherish the feeling while you’re at the pedestal. **Live in the moment.** You’ve reached the top. You’ve experienced the highs. Two weeks or 10 seconds, it does not matter. The sensation had entered your system. Nothing is going to take that away.

Cherish the pain when you’re down. Be aware when you’re hurt. **Appreciate solitude.** That’s the time for deep reflection. Look forward to another day. The suffering would perish, but your soul won’t.

**Life is but a dream.** We can never know what’s in store for us. We can wish, but only to some extent. And there’s no guarantee of a happy ending. You can wake up one day and everything can vanish in a blink. Refrain from worrying. Expect less. **Accept what is.**
