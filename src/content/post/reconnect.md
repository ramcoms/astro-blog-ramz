I just heard the news that a relative passed away due to illness. His family is from northern Luzon, whereas I was raised in the south. They would come to our province for the holidays every now and then. Those were the only times we were able to talk. We used to be close as kids. However, as time went and we grew older, we eventually lost touch.

So the news came as a complete shock. I thought it was sudden. I did not even know he was sick. And now he’s gone. I can’t even remember the last time we spoke. But I’m sure it was a long time ago.

It’s amazing how quickly people come and go. At some point, they were constant in your life. Then after a while, you have a new circle. And you can only imagine what they’re up to nowadays. (Well, there’s social media.)

It’s like playing an RPG. As the protagonist, you meet characters in certain chapters. And every chapter introduces new characters. You encounter new ones as the game progresses. Some are important in completing the quests. While others are just padding in the story.

Is there someone in your past you want to reconnect with? Try it today. A simple message won’t hurt.
