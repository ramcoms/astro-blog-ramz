I recently read an article that talks about constructing a simplicity framework. Itâ€™s a guide on living a life that focuses on what matters. The article says that one may start with two lists. One for things we want to remove (reduce) and another for things we want to spend more time on.

After some thinking, here are the lists I came up with. These cover my mental, financial, development, and health spheres.

### Less

- mindless screen time
- impulsive spending
- social media
- busyness with shallow results
- procrastination

### More

- reading
- intentional spending
- passion projects
- deep work
- exercise

I felt like the exercise was a great opportunity to reflect. It helped me be more aware of the things that affect my overall well-being, positively or negatively. Like most things that need improvement, it always starts with self-awareness.
