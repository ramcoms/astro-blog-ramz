We all dream of our ideal lives. From big houses to luxury cars to prestigious titles to elite connections, we each paint an idea of how we want our lives to be.

Here’s how I imagined it to be. I’m in the corporate world, climbing the ladder. With the salary I’m making, I’m living comfortably. I can provide for the needs and wants of my family. We have a not-so-huge but great house. My father has his dream car as I promised. We travel abroad for leisure from time to time. I manage a simple business and have no debts. I pledge regularly to a charity.

My idea of an ideal life revolves around my greatest why – my family.

I can’t help but compare myself with others. Sometimes, I wonder if I made the right choice in moving from the private to the government service early in my working career. I think I may have jumped too soon. I think the private sector would have exposed me to more opportunities had I stayed. But due to lack of guidance and choosing the path other people wanted for me, I made the move. It’s not hard to think that somehow I’m stuck and got nowhere else to go.

Today, I’m in my late twenties. We live comfortably but not to my ideal standards. I could provide but it’s challenging not to be able to give all that I want them to have. We have a family house in the province. I can’t give yet the promised car to my father. We don’t travel much. I still don’t have my business and I still have an outstanding <a href='https://blog.ramzzz.one/posts/character/'>debt.</a> I give a monthly donation to a <a href='https://www.worldvision.org.ph/about-us/'>non-profit organization.</a>

Having a competitive and <a href='https://blog.ramzzz.one/posts/growth/'>growth</a> mindset, I am in no way satisfied with where I am at this stage of my life. I think I’m a bit late compared to my batchmates. But I do believe that everyone has their own timelines. I also believe in luck as much as that it takes hard work to be on the top. I may not be halfway to the ideal life I dream about, but I have at least a roadmap to get me there. That being said, I may have all the plans I could think of, my journey is still up to His plan. I just have to believe and enjoy the ride.
