You value a life of service. For the longest time, all you think about is how you can provide value to people. Family, friends, strangers.

You attend to their needs more than yours. You care about their feelings more than yours. Behind the acts that seemed to seek approval is the innate selflessness in you. You are selfless. And there is nothing wrong with that.

Life’s simple purpose is to do good. There should be no deep reasoning or justifications. Just do and be good. Doing the right thing steers our ship. And caring for people is doing the right thing.

But on this journey, you are forgetting one thing. Just like them, you are a person. A person who needs attention and care. Not from others, but from oneself.

_Fill your cup first before filling others._

_You cannot take care of others if you do not take care of yourself._

_You cannot pour from an empty cup._

We could go on and on with these quotes. But see, the message is clear. And it’s that important that it’s worth emphasizing.

For a change, think about how you can provide value to yourself. Who must attend to your needs? Who must care about your emotions? You do not need to look outside. Look within yourself.

Before thinking of others, consider thinking of yourself. Not narcissistically, but as a form of self-reflection.

Make yourself happy to share happiness with others. Strengthen yourself to provide support to someone. Be financially capable so you could provide more to those in need.

Be selfish.
