I used to run before the pandemic. It was the only exercise I relied on to stay in shape. It was something I could do without much preparation. I just put on my running clothes, and I’m set to go. But like how everything came to a pause during the pandemic, so did my running.

I was not a hardcore runner and had not even finished a marathon. I think 10km was the most I’ve ever run in a single session. But I did really enjoy it, especially when I ran in the mornings.

**So after a two-year hiatus, I started running again**. I signed up for <a href='https://www.pinoyfitness.com/list-of-events/'>virtual runs</a> for added motivation.

In August, I completed two races that spanned a combined 85 km. This surprised me because I was naturally feeling rusty after a long break. I started slowly but set a goal of completing at least 5 km on each run. And doing so required discipline and commitment. I challenged myself to get up early and go for a run. I’m a morning person but I figured I would need a lot of resolve to push this through.

One thing I do is to lessen friction. Like if I plan to run tomorrow morning, I’ll prepare my running stuff and map my route tonight, before I go to sleep. So when the alarm goes off at 5, I get up, change to my running gear, grab my earphones, hit record on Strava, and head out. I’ve been able to run 3 to 4 times a week thanks to this simple trick.

I love mornings so going for runs before daybreak is a pleasure. There is peace in the view of the empty streets of the usually-crowded city. I get to listen again to <a href='https://www.selfimprovementdailytips.com/'>podcasts</a> which I find hard to do these days. I am discovering new routes in nearby places. And most importantly, I get to talk to myself. I can be alone with my thoughts. Ponder about life, entertain my imagination, and cultivate inspiration and ideas. **Escape for a while**.

For me, running offers benefits beyond health. **It challenges my physical limits while allowing me to reflect and rediscover**. It nurtures both mind and body.

I’ll ~~try to hard to~~ make the habit stick.
