As a longtime fan of Ed Sheeran, I was excited to watch his documentary “The Sum of It All”. The four-part series provides an intimate look into his life and career, and showcases his growth as an artist over the years.

I’ve been a fan of Ed since the A-Team and Lego House days. There is something about the simplicity and rawness of his music that resonated with me.

If I had to choose a superpower, it would be the ability to capture the essence of the human experience and express it eloquently through songs. Something that Ed apparently possesses. (Teleportation would be pretty cool too.)

I used to write songs when I was younger, starting in highschool when I learned to play the guitar. I would often lock myself in my room after school, strum some chords and pull some strings of my juvenile heart.

Back then, local rock bands were dominating the music scene. My early writing was heavily influenced by artists like Ely, Rico, Chito. Even Hale, Sponge Cola and Callalily, to name a few. Been a fan of John Mayer, too. (Not a local)

To this day, I still keep my old notebooks filled with my words. Scribbles that turned into verses, poems, and songs. And it still amazes me how the young me was able to morph some melodies and made-up phrases into songs that were my own.

One of my favorites was a lullaby that goes like:

_Could you stay?
Be my pillow until I’m okay
Could you sing?
Be a cloud and sway me like a swing_

It’s simple and sincere. Though I’m not a singer, I love singing it.

I have around 50 songs in these notebooks, maybe more. A collection of thoughts and emotions expressed through pen, paper and a guitar. They’re songs meant for personal consumption, a means of looking back and reflecting on my views and feelings at different points in my life. They come in handy for occasional reminiscing.

Going back to Edward, watching the documentary reignited my own love for songwriting, something I’ve let slip over the years. It reminded me of the joy that comes with creating something from scratch and the satisfaction of seeing your ideas come to life through music.

Maybe it’s time I flex that creativity muscle once again.

I’m in no way as great as Ed but today he reminded me of an outlet I once had.

A confidant for inspiration and frustration when there was no one else to turn to.
