The other day, I went to a locksmith. I parked in front of a 7-11 next to the stall.

When I returned to my motorcycle, a little girl approached me and asked for some extra change. I gave her a 10 peso coin. She then proceeded to the shop’s entrance and went on to walk up to the people entering.

I noticed that she was with an older woman who I thought to be her grandma. I politely asked whether they would want to eat, to which they quickly replied yes. I wanted to treat them inside, but I had some things I need to run first. So I handed them some money instead.

The girl was ecstatic while her grandma whispered, ‘Sorry sir, salamat po.’ I was surprised by her apology but I did not mind. I was just glad I was able to help.

The twinkle in their eyes could not deny the smiles concealed behind their face masks.

I was moved. I left with a happy heart.

They say money won’t buy me happiness. But more of it will multiply my capacity to help. And by sharing more, I can duplicate the joy in my heart and in others. Ergo, becoming wealthy is one of the keys to my happiness.
