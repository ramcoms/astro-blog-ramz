I enjoy reading quotes. Inspirational, funny, amusing, thought-provoking. Whichever.

A quote is a great way to start the day. While sipping your coffee, read one. On the way to work, you may notice some.

Quotes are everywhere. From Seneca to Aristotle to Jim Carrey. The list goes on and on. It’s wisdom in one statement. And it’s a wonder how powerful a single line can be. How that one quote can ignite a spark. Ideas. Inspiration. Hope.

The smallest of ideas can lead to big things. A smidgeon of inspiration can pave the way for success. With a glimmer of hope, life unfolds.

Little things matter.
