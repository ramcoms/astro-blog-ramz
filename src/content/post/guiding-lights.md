The traffic lights are a common sight on my everyday commute to and from work. The ones with the red, green, and orange lights, you know. Red for stop. Green for go. And orange means slow down.

And every time I come across one, I always wonder. What if each of us had our own personal set of traffic lights? Something that is influenced by an unseen power, invisible force, fate or universe. Whatever.

Would that work? An additional mechanism to help in making judgments. Something to serve as guidance when logic and emotions are at odds with each other. When we are unable to rely on our intuition or logic.

“Should I quit my job now?” Your head says yes, but your heart says otherwise. And the light flashes green.

“Should I tweet this?” It is a hard no for logic but an emotional yes. The red light flashes.

“Should I spend the money on this overpriced, completely unnecessary, yet well-marketed cooking pan?” Logic is a bit on the fence but emotions are high on the purchase. Oranges flash across the screen.

That way, I’m sure it would be easier to make decisions. Without regard for the repercussions, we leave everything to that unseen force. It would be a mess for sure, but I think it would be fun. Who knows, having our own guiding lights might just bring order to the chaos that is life.
