last sunday, i went on a long slow distance run.
i thought on trying out a new route.
because running could be boring.
so mix things up!

so the night before, i planned my route.
i ended up with a route in bgc, a favorite place for runners.
studied it, a little over 10km.
it would be my first time trying it out.

next day, sunday, 5-ish in the am.
i downloaded an episode of no dunks podcast.
synced the map to my watch.
and off i went.

i know the place.
but i was not exactly familiar with the streets.
while the map was displayed on my watch, i ended up with a few wrong turns.

nevertheless, i enjoyed the run.
felt great running in a different route and scenery.
saw a lot of runners and cyclists.

life has a way of surprising us.
we set sail with a map in hand.
our dreams are etched in the stars.
only to find ourselves shipwrecked on an unfamiliar shore.
the life we envisioned often diverges from reality.
and sometimes, just sometimes, we yearn to escape it all.
