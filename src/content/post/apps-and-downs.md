I love apps. They’re the second greatest gift to mankind, next only to pizza.

Today I have 82 apps on my phone. Half of which are productivity apps, a few for messaging, and some for testing.

The Appstore is my candy store. I spend more time on it than on social media. I’m that guy who wastes time testing apps and sending feedback to developers.

Gone were the days when phones were only used for calls and messages. Now phones control our lives. And apps rule our phones.

When was the last time you woke up in the morning and went straight to the bathroom without checking your phone?

**Apps help improve life management.** That’s how they were advertised. They have a single goal – to solve a problem. In my case, they serve as tools in productivity, communication, and leisure. And they do a great job.

I try to be a digital minimalist. I practice Inbox Zero. And while I like exploring apps, I try to be mindful of which apps are worthy of a spot on my home screen.

Most of my apps are productivity apps, which promise increased, well.. productivity. However, I often find myself on the other side of the fence. **Instead of being an efficient worker, I become an effective time-waster.**

I spend more time looking for and tinkering with apps than actually being productive with them.

There’s also the shiny object syndrome. App-hopping leads to more wasted time. You can just never resist that shiny new app. Never.

Another problem with apps is the notifications. The fake urgency they bring mess up our deep work.

We are now in a mobile-first generation. And apps are products of technology. As cute as they seem (little icons on our home screens), they’ve become as powerful as ever. **They exist to make our lives easier. But without motive and discipline, they are futile.**

We should take advantage of the tools we were given, but only to the extent of serving their purpose. **Too much reliance spells disaster.** We should have total control of how we use these apps and tools.

Or in the end, they might end up owning us.
