I’m a fan of technology, gadgets in particular.
It gets me excited. It keeps me entertained.
But it comes with a price – a syndrome.

People always want the latest and the newest.
Due to a lack of contentment, we are trapped in consumerism. We tend to buy more even if we have limited resources. And that’s how we acquire debt. **We spend beyond our means to keep up with the trend.**

One good example would be our phones.
Every year, new and improved models of phones are released. And as a result, people also tend to replace their phones yearly.

**Shiny Object Syndrome**. SOS. The acronym itself cries for help.

I realized what’s new isn’t always the most useful and practical. I like exploring new phone features, gadgets, and apps. But at the end of the day, **I only keep the useful ones, the ones that really matter.**
