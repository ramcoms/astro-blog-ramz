There’s a raging war within all of us. Every second of every day. The struggle to be good is evident. Distractions are abundant. Pride, dishonesty, jealousy, greed.

And we are constantly losing the battles. **Resistance is naturally weak**. It’s easy to succumb to the enemies. We don’t have the mechanisms to overcome. There’s so much on our plate but the other side only has us to seize. They come in pairs, sometimes threes. And it looks likes they are winning. Every single time.

We only have ourselves. I, me. You, you. It may be one against a hundred but that doesn’t matter. Control is one-way. Focus on you. **Become better. Just overcome, little by little**. Time isn’t scarce so we can take it slow. It’ll be a long war, and we’ll take it on one battle at a time.

It is a challenge we didn’t want but can’t run from. And it’s part of living. Remember, **life is not a smooth sail.**
