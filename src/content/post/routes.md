There are two available routes on my way home from the office.

One is shorter and would get me home faster. But the highway is dangerous with buses, speeding cars, and unruly drivers on the road.

The other route is farther. And it would take me a bit longer to get home. But I get to see a view of the horizon along the way.

I used to take the first route most of the time. I tend to rush going home after a long day’s work. Who wouldn’t?

However, dealing with speeding cars and _kamote_ drivers are another kind of work.

Another thing is pollution. Smoke is another foe on the road. I could always close my helmet’s visor and I do have my mask on but that black smoke is persistent. Like that one friend (or foe) you can’t get rid of.

I like the adrenaline though. But it’s exhausting.

Recently, I’ve been taking the longer route. Along the way, there is a long stretch of an elevated highway which made the view possible. While there are some bumps in the road, the view of the sky makes one’s patient fairly longer.

A few buildings block the horizon but they probably make it more scenic. The combination of orange and blue hues signals the approaching nighttime. I could just slow down a bit without some cars honking on my tail.

I don’t mind the extra time it takes to reach home.

It’s a refreshing sight. It’s a different experience.
