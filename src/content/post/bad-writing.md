I suck at writing.

And I used to be a perfectionist.

Before I could publish anything, there would be a long back and forth battle between me and the _save_ button. That guy’s a little hard to please.

You know what, scratch that. It was me who was hard to please.

I was so conscious of what others might think. I thought of too many _what-ifs_. I was wary of every spelling, grammar and punctuation. And after all that? My published posts barely satisfy me.

Maybe I’ve got high standards. Or maybe I’m just really bad. This realization would upset me yesterday.

Today I could not care less. I just want to write. And I aim to write daily. Soon I will.

I write for myself, at least in this blog. I want to express and get better at writing. Writing here has been an excellent reflection and practice for me. It’s a bonus if someone would pick up something useful from what I share.

So I will keep posting whatever comes out of my shy wandering brain. I will keep them coming, good and bad ideas alike. I will be a little less perfectionist and just hit that publish button.
