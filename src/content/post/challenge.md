Ryan Holiday, in _The Daily Stoic_, expressed that we have two essential tasks in life: to be a good person and to pursue the occupation that you love.

That seems ideal, I thought.

Being good is sometimes relative. And I believe no one in this world is a truly “good” person. Life isn’t supposed to be lived in a straight line. It is a forest without us knowing what’s out there. **We have to make mistakes to learn and grow**. And we have to act on what’s thrown at us. We aim to be good. But it would be a constant test, a never-ending challenge.

The second task falls in line with the follow-your-passion cliche. I just don’t subscribe to it anymore. If I were to ask five people right now if they love their current job, I doubt I would get a yes answer. Nowadays, most people do not have the luxury of choosing jobs. **It is enough to put food on the table**. As for me, I don’t love my job as much as I love making money. Seriously. I have a lot of interests but I’m stuck practicing my profession. And it’s not always that I would get the opportunity to earn in doing the things that I want. It’s good to have a job that you truly love and pays well at the same time. But for now, **it is about survival.**
