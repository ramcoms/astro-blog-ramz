For the last two years, I’ve been riding a motorcycle to work. I seldom take public transportation. And it got even less frequent when the pandemic hit.

This past month, I rode a jeepney for the first time in what seemed like forever. It felt like a new experience yet it was familiar.

I’m not one who gets emotional but this one hit close to home. Quite dramatic, yes. But there’s something about commuting that I miss the most.

During commutes, I like to space out and get really deep in my thoughts which I find hard to do if I’m driving. I get to ignore people and just be “with myself”.

The noise while filtered somehow helps in concentration. The chatter in the background adds flavor to the scene. The glances intensify my disinterest. It feels good to be alone in the sea of people.

**I immerse myself in the outside forces and dive with the demons inside.** Ironic and therapeutic.

**It’s crazy how something so ordinary could bring us joy after living without it for so long. And it’s amazing how something so mundane could make an impact in our lives.**

Truly, **it’s the little things.**
