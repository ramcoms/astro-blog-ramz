i lost my internet connection twice last week.
it felt hopeless.
staring at the blinking LOS red light offered no solution.

the first disconnection happened on a Friday.
i had to make do with mobile data for the weekends.
the technician visited the following Monday, and the connection got fixed.

here came Saturday.
while eating lunch, a visitor reappeared.
guess who/what?
the freaking red light!
an SOS situation!
i kept my calm.
it'd probably be a quick visit.
but no, it needed another intervention.
luckily, a mighty technician came the next day, and fixed the damn internet.

internet is a must nowadays!
but losing it for a few days provided some time for reflection.
i've always wanted to decrease my screen time anyway.

because of that dreaded red signal, i was able to:

- read more pages
- play with my son more
- do some decluttering
- write this rant/ blog post (yeah a new post after 4896426 months)

today it seems like we cannot live without the internet anymore.
we always want to connect and be updated 247.
while this rings true, occasional 'disconnection' would not hurt.

go watch the sunset.

ride a bike.

run.

touch some grass.
